"A.R.M" (A.R.M), the highly anticipated action thriller starring Tamil superstar Vijay, has taken the Indian box office by storm, leaving a trail of mixed reviews, controversies, and record-breaking collections. This article delves into everything you need to know about the film, from its streaming availability and intricate plot to its star-studded cast, challenging production journey, and the buzz surrounding its future.

Where to Watch A.R.M:

After a successful theatrical run, A.R.M is now available for streaming on Netflix. You can experience Vijay's dual-role performance and the film's action-packed sequences from the comfort of your home. The film is streaming in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi, catering to a wider audience.

What is the Movie A.R.M About?

A.R.M is an action thriller that follows the story of M.S. Gandhi, a former leader of an anti-terrorism squad, who is forced to confront the consequences of his past actions. The film spans across two timelines, 2008 and 2024, showcasing Gandhi's journey from a dedicated squad leader to a disillusioned immigration officer and his eventual return to action.

What is the Story of A.R.M?

In 2008, Gandhi and his Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS) successfully intercept a terrorist named Omar and retrieve uranium from their former chief, Rajiv Menon, who is accused of treason. Believing Menon to be dead, they return to their undercover lives. However, tragedy strikes when Gandhi's family is attacked in Bangkok, leading to the disappearance of his son, Jeevan, and the emotional breakdown of his wife, Anu.

Years later, in 2024, Gandhi lives a solitary life as an immigration officer. His world is turned upside down when he encounters a young man who bears an uncanny resemblance to his lost son. This encounter pulls Gandhi back into the world of espionage and forces him to confront a web of deceit, betrayal, and revenge, leading to a thrilling climax atop the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium.

Is the A.R.M Movie a Real Story?

No, A.R.M is not based on a true story. It's a fictional action thriller that incorporates elements of espionage, family drama, and human cloning. While the film touches upon themes of terrorism and national security, its narrative is purely imaginative, designed to entertain and thrill audiences.

Is the A.R.M Movie Good or Bad?

A.R.M has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. While some praise Vijay's performance, action sequences, and the film's climax, others criticize its lack of character development, predictable plot, and over-reliance on fan service. Ultimately, whether the film is good or bad depends on individual preferences and expectations.

What is the Story of the A.R.M Movie?

The story of the A.R.M movie, as explained earlier, revolves around M.S. Gandhi, an anti-terrorism squad leader haunted by his past, who must confront his presumed-dead son, now a trained assassin seeking revenge. The film blends action, suspense, and emotional drama, culminating in a high-stakes showdown.

Who is the Villain in the A.R.M Movie?

The primary antagonist in A.R.M is Rajiv Menon, a former squad chief who seeks revenge against Gandhi and his team for the loss of his family. Menon manipulates Gandhi's son, Jeevan, turning him into a weapon against his own father, adding a layer of emotional complexity to the conflict.

The filming took place across various locations, including Chennai, Thailand, Hyderabad, Sri Lanka, Pondicherry, Thiruvananthapuram, Russia, and the United States, showcasing the film's global scale.

The production involved extensive use of visual effects, particularly for Vijay's de-aging in one of his dual roles. The team utilized advanced technology and collaborated with international VFX companies to achieve a convincing and seamless transformation.

A.R.M: Music

The film's soundtrack is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, marking his second collaboration with Vijay after a long gap.

A.R.M: Release and Reception

A.R.M was released worldwide on September 5, 2024, in standard and IMAX formats, generating immense hype and anticipation. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising Vijay's performance and action sequences, while others criticized the weak storyline and lack of character development.

Despite the mixed reception, A.R.M became a massive commercial success, setting several box office records. It emerged as the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2024, the third highest-grossing Indian film of 2024, and the fourth highest-grossing Tamil film A.R.M.

The film faced a few controversies, including:

Title Dispute: Telugu film director Naresh Kuppili raised objections against the title "A.R.M," claiming he was already working on a project with the same name.
Song Lyrics: A social activist filed a police complaint against the song "Whistle Podu," alleging that its lyrics promoted drug addiction and rowdyism.
Ticket Pricing: Complaints were raised against a multiplex in Chennai for charging exorbitant ticket prices and making food options mandatory.
A.R.M: Future

A sequel titled "A.R.M vs Original Gangster" (A.R.M vs OG) was announced in the film's mid-credits scene. However, the project's future remains uncertain due to Vijay's decision to quit acting and focus on his political career. The director has expressed hope for the sequel's realization but acknowledges the challenges involved.

Conclusion

A.R.M is a visually spectacular and action-packed film that showcases Vijay's star power and Venkat Prabhu's directorial style. While it may not be a critically acclaimed masterpiece, it's an entertaining watch for Vijay fans and action movie enthusiasts. Its record-breaking box office performance demonstrates Vijay's immense popularity and the audience's appetite for larger-than-life action entertainers.
